# Code-refactor

Bind the interface of the Repository via a ServiceProvider instead of directly using the RepositoryClass. This provides more control over the application's structure.

Omit variables that are not in use to free up memory.

Utilize proper return types in function documentation instead of using "mixed". This provides better insight into what the method returns.


Maintain a configuration file with defaults and load the config key to make changes. This avoids the need for multiple if-else conditions.

Consider using a default value of 'no' for the customer_phone_type in the config file. This can help eliminate unnecessary else conditions throughout the system.


Use a simple "return" statement instead of wrapping everything with the "response" method  Laravel will automatically wrap the return value in a response if needed. Use the "response" method only when specific status codes and headers need to be sent. because Laravel Eloquent can do that for strings you can return response

Apply validation to any function that passes data, especially for database queries.

Use camelCase for variable names according to the PSR-2 standard.


Avoid key validation within the Repository. Perform all necessary validation using the Validator in the Controller.
or you can use Laravel  custom Request to valide the request and auhorization

Provide method documentation that explains the purpose and functionality of each method.

Avoid database interaction from the Controller. Keep the Controller responsible for handling the business logic and delegate database operations to the Repository.


Use single quotes ('') instead of double quotes ("") where appropriate.
